### Objective
Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

"Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. So, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. The mathematical equation describing it is Xn+2= Xn+1 + Xn"
