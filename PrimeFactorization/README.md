# Prime Factorization #

### What i Learned
- Implementation of the List class, and how it differs from the Array and ArrayList classes
- Got pretty intimate with if-else statements and loops here, and ways to break out of them
- Catching multiple exceptions while giving the user another chance, "Press 0 to exit" should be the only way out

### Challenges
- Combining exception handling for weird input while preventing the loop from repeating infinitely
- IsPrime method. I had to be certain I understood the definition of a prime number, then think about how to break down those rules into code

### To Do
- Take another look at efficiency of IsPrime() and PrimeFactors()

#### Expected Output
