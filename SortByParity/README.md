#### Objective
Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.

#### What I Learned
JavaScript makes manipulating arrays super simple. You mean I can RESIZE it whenever I want?! I learned the splice() method, which allowed me to remove an element as long as I know its index.
